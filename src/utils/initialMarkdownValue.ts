Welcome! This is a powerful minimalistic app to write small markdown notes 📝

Click "Show preview" under the *Preview* box to see the rendered markdown.

**Amazing** text *highlighting*, presets and high perfomance ✨

### Happy writing! ✍🏼

*P.S.* Make sure you've tried the **dark theme**, it's lit! (top right corner ↗️)`
